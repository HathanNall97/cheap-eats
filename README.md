## Why it was devolped 
- College students are faced with many expenses, such as tuition, textbooks, and housing, and often need to turn to the cheapest options available. These options often boil down to whatever fast food they haven’t had recently.  It is known that fast food is detrimental to a person’s long-term health.  This app would give students an easy way to find, track, and attend events that offer free or cheap food.  Additionally, the app would give students the ability to find local deal and make the most of their dollar. 
- This application will also be usable for campus-adjacent food vendors as well as student organizations that wish to use the application to advertise sales and events. This tool will allow for verified student organizations and vendors to post events that will notify students with appropriate preferences. This will provide both parties with foot traffic and regular customers to boost interest in the event hoster

### Product Functions 
- The functions of the CheapEats application allow the users of the application to explore a vast amount of options within the application including getting notifications about events, users posting about events, and other users rating / liking / disliking those posts. Any user can filter these posts and events to their choosing.
